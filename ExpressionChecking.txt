Static Checking To-Do List

Expression Implementations
==========================
CharLiteralExpr - Needs to hold value
StringLiteralExpr - Needs to hold value
IntLiteralExpr - Need to think how we deal with uints & longs
FloatLiteralExpr - Similar to Int, needs to parse & deal with doubles
BinaryExpr - != and == don't work. (kind of big) ***
			 Needs better error messages w.r.t. overloading.
UnaryExpr - Needs better error messages w.r.t. overloading.
AssignExpr - Needs support for things besides = (need to decide on how that will work)
CallExpr - Support for overloading.
		   Support for calling constructors.
IndexExpr - NYI (we need an array type before this is useful anyhow - very low priority)
MemberExpr - NYI (big-ish) ***

BoolLiteralExpr - Done
NullLiteralExpr - Done
ThisExpr - Done
CastExpr - Done
TernaryExpr - Done
NameExpr - Done

TODO: MEMORY TRACKING
TODO: Constant folding
TODO: Clean up casting where necessary. Current stuff is rather meh
TODO: Comma operator? bleh.
TODO: Need to preserve line info on transformed exprs so we can error on them later

Statement Implementations
=========================
Throw - NYI
Expression statement - Must check that output value isn't a 'pseudovalue' (although perhaps it doesn't matter)
For - NYI
Foreach - NYI
Switch - NYI
Try-Catch - NYI

Local def - Done
While - Done
Do-While - Done
If - Done
Empty - Done
Break - Done
Continue - Done
Return - Done
Block - Done

TODO: Error if all flows don't result in a return (if it doesn't return void) (VARIABLE FLOW ANALYSIS)
TODO: Error if we use uninited variables (VARIABLE FLOW ANALYSIS)

Assign Ops
==========

LHS must always be an LValue

+=
-=
*=
/=

LHS must be integer or float, rhs must convert to lhs type

%=

LHS must be integer or float, rhs must convert to lhs type
(we can do % on floats)

**=

LHS must be float, RHS must be float

&=
|=
^=

LHS must be int, RHS must convert to same type

<<=
>>=

LHS must be int, RHS must convert to i4

&&=
||=

TODO: How should short circuiting work with this? >:|
LHS & RHS must be bool (these are very LOW PRIORITY)
