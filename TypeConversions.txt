Implicit Conversions

(anything) -> itself

TODO: what about casting TO char? Is char 32-bits or not?
bool
byte -> unsigned/signed short+int+long, float, double
sbyte -> signed short+int+long, float, double *
ushort -> unsigned/signed int+long, float, double
short -> signed int+long, float, double *
uint -> unsigned/signed long, float, double
int -> signed long, float, double *
ulong -> float, double
long -> float, double
float -> double
double
char -> (same as ushort?) *
string -> object
object

(any class) -> base class, or object

Explicit Conversions
(All conversions are a superset of implicit conversions)

Everything casts to object (boxing), except void of course
bool -> any integral or FP type* (becomes 1 or 0)
(unsigned/signed byte,short,int,long,float,double,char) -> any integral or FP type
object -> any type (except void)
(some class A) -> any class B that is related to A at all
